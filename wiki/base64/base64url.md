`base64url_decode` is a function typically used to decode data that has been encoded using the **Base64 URL encoding** scheme. It's an alternative version of the standard Base64 encoding, designed to be URL-safe.

### Differences between Base64 and Base64 URL:

Base64 URL encoding is used for encoding data in URLs and file names, where certain characters from the regular Base64 encoding could cause issues. Here's how they differ:

1.  **Base64 encoding** uses:
    
    -   `+` for the plus sign.
    -   `/` for the forward slash.
    -   `=` for padding (optional in some cases).
2.  **Base64 URL encoding** uses:
    
    -   `-` for the plus sign (`+`).
    -   `_` for the forward slash (`/`).
    -   No padding (`=` is omitted).

This makes Base64 URL encoding more compatible with URLs and filenames, where characters like `+` and `/` can have special meanings or be restricted.

### Why use `base64url_decode`?

The `base64url_decode` function is used to decode strings that have been encoded in Base64 URL format. For example, this is commonly used when dealing with **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)**, as the signature and payload of a JWT are Base64 URL-encoded.

### Usage:

If you're working with JWT tokens or URL-safe data, you'll encounter Base64 URL encoding often. In Python, libraries like `base64` donâ€™t directly support Base64 URL encoding/decoding, so you'd use specific functions like `base64url_decode` to handle it.

### Example in Python (with `jwt` library):

### Example:
```python
import base64

def base64url_decode(input_str):
    # Add padding if necessary
    padding = len(input_str) % 4
    if padding:
        input_str += "=" * (4 - padding)
    return base64.urlsafe_b64decode(input_str)

encoded = "aGVsbG8td29ybGQ_"
decoded = base64url_decode(encoded)
print(decoded.decode('utf-8'))

```

1.  **Base64 URL-encoded string**:

`aGVsbG8td29ybGQ_`

-   In Base64 URL encoding, the `+` character is replaced by `-`, and `/` is replaced by `_`.
    
-   **Decoding**: When you use `base64url_decode`, it will properly decode the encoded string by:
    
    -   Replacing `-` back with `+`
    -   Replacing `_` back with `/`
    -   Handling the padding correctly if necessary
    
    The decoded string might be something like:
`hello-world`

So, `base64url_decode` is used to safely decode URL-encoded Base64 data, making it suitable for scenarios like decoding JWTs or other URL-safe payloads.
